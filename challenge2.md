Using the file called `menu-leve2.json`, do:

Create a logic that renders this menu using javascript:
- CSS or the look and feel is not important for now;
- Semantic HTML is also not important for now;
- Just go through the object and render each menu level with the necessary nested children.

- The Premium menu item should only be rendered if you pass an argument to IsPremiumUser with a true value

- The Github repository children menu items should only be rendered if you pass an argument to IsGitUser with a true value
